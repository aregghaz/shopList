You agree that these Terms and all incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by shoplist, in its sole discretion, to a third party in the event of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets and other transactions.

    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">If a dispute arises between you and shoplist, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and shoplist agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of these Terms or our Services (a “Claim”) in accordance with one of the subsections below or as we and you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">All claims you bring against shoplist must be resolved in accordance with this Legal Disputes Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to the Legal Disputes Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to the Legal Disputes Section, shoplist may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $1000, provided that shoplist has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

You agree that any cause of action brought by you and arising out of or related to your use of the Services and/or the Website must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, except that shoplist may commence any such cause of action in accordance with the applicable statute of limitations under California law.

We may suspend any user account without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the program.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">We require Vendors to comply with our resolution process. Customers and Vendors permit us to make a final decision, in our sole discretion, on any claim that a Customer or a Vendors files with shoplist under the shoplist User Protection Policy. If we resolve a dispute in the Customer’s favor, we will refund the Customer for the full cost of the service item (including any applicable sales taxes and service related fees) and we will require the Vendor to reimburse us for the amount due to the Customer. Without limiting the foregoing, Vendors may not have to pay a reimbursement for a shoplist claim if they provide the documentation (for example, delivery confirmation or proof that the service item was delivered as described) indicated in the shoplist User Protection policy. If we resolve a dispute in the Customer’s favor, we may take steps, at our sole discretion, downgrading Vendor’s rating.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">Changing a reimbursement method will not affect shoplist’s use of a payment method on file for other purposes (such as payment of your shoplist fees).

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">Every new Purchase Order entered into the system generates notifications and email messages sent to the Customer and to all Vendors of Services purchased as part of the Purchase Order. Each Vendor of the Purchase Order receives a notification in the system about its portion of the order (Sale Order). Every Service item of the Sale Order, subject to sale to Customer by Vendor, is called Order. Statuses of the Order from the Customer side are same as from the Vendor side, as both the Customer and the Vendor can monitor and manage the Order progress.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">In addition to the notification about newly received Order, Vendor receives an e-mail (on Vendor’s e-mail address on file) containing electronic invoice and Sale Order details, including items purchased from this Vendor, total amount due to this Vendor, delivery or pick-up address, rush order, etc.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">When a Vendor changes the status of the Order along with the Order progress, a notification is sent to Customer about the progress of one or more items in the Purchase Order</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">From the status “New Order” Vendor can change the status of the Order to one of: “Accepted”, “Rejected”. If the Vendor does not have the requested Services in stock, then the Order status can be changed to “Rejected”. &nbsp;This action, however, negatively impacts Vendor’s credibility on the Website and affects Vendor’s ratings, because it is Vendor’s responsibility to make sure that posted Services along with their current prices are available on the Website. If the Vendor acknowledges the receipt of a valid Order, it can change the Order status to “Accepted” and a corresponding notification and email is sent to the Customer acknowledging the receipt of the Order by Vendor. At this stage Customer can still cancel the Order (items in the Purchase Order).</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">Once the Vendor starts processing the Order, it should change the Order status to “In Fulfillment”. This status blocks Customer’s actions for cancelling the Order. At this stage Vendor prepares the Order by collecting and packaging the Order and prepares for shipping &nbsp;or pickup. Vendor may use its own or shoplist’s special packaging when preparing the Order for shipment. Packaging may include boxes with vendor’s or shoplist’s logo or custom paper and plastic bags. In case of packaging with shoplist logo, this packaging materials should be distributed to Vendor beforehand and to be in sufficient quantities and inventory at all times.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">Once items in the Sale Order are ready for shipment, Vendor prints out an Invoice from within the system that contains the Sale Order number and itemized list of items ready for shipment for that Sale Order, items price, total sums. This Invoice is affixed to the Sale Order packaging</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">If COD (CASH) payment method was used in the Sale Order, then Vendor must also issue a cash register receipt and affix it to the Sale Order packaging as well.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">Vendor must deliver the Sale Order to the address specified in the “Pick-up From” field of the Sale Order. This usually is Vendor’s warehouse or one of it’s chain stores or single stores. &nbsp;Vendor can change the statuses of each Order in the Sale Order to “Ready for Pick-up” or “Ready for Delivery”, depending on the delivery or self-pick-up option specified in the Purchase Order. Other choices are not available for the Vendor at this stage of the Order processing.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">If a self-pickup option was specified in the Order, then a notification and email is sent to the Customer notifying of the “Ready for pick-up” status for each Order in the Sale Order. If a delivery option was specified, then a notification and email is sent to the Dispatcher of the Order notifying of the “Ready for delivery” status of the Order.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">After the Order receives a status “Ready for Delivery” it awaits for Dispatcher’s pick-up. Dispatcher, during Order pick-up must present to the Vendor a Pick-up Receipt as a proof that Order was picked up by the Dispatcher. In return, the Vendor signs a corresponding box of the Shipping Bill that the Order was handed to the Dispatcher. After handing the Order to the Dispatcher Vendor marks the Order as Shipped. At this stage Dispatcher can deliver the Order to the Customer (or Recipient) or bring it to shoplist’s distribution Hub.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span style="font-size:14px">If, upon delivery to Recipient, the Order is refused by the Recipient, then Dispatcher must return the Order to the Vendor and process the return. Vendor, in its turn, must change the status of the Order to “Refused”.</span></p>
